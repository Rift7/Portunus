  Portunus - The API Key Collector
</h1>

*"API keys are like underwear: don't share them, don't leave them lying around, and don't go out in public waving them around."*

Do you ever find yourself on the wild, wild web and stumble upon an API key or two? Are you tired of manually hunting for those elusive keys like it's some kind of prehistoric foraging exercise? Well, fear not! Introducing **Portunus** by Rift7, the ultimate API key collecting tool that does the hunting for you, so you can focus on the more interesting (and probably less ethical) aspects of your endeavors.

## Features 🚀

- Automagically sniffs out API keys on any webpage you visit.
- Built-in support for customizable regex queries. (You know, because not all API keys are created equal.)
- A sleek and sexy popup displaying all the found keys in a neat, little table. You can copy, delete or just admire them.
- Worried about losing your keys? We've got you covered with persistence across pages, tabs, and browser refreshes.
- Need to share your findings with your buddies? Export your precious loot to a CSV file with just a click.

## Installation 💿

1. Clone this repo and feel the power surging through your fingertips.
2. Load the extension into your favorite browser (as long as your favorite browser is Firefox... 😏).
3. Open the popup, add your regex queries, and marvel at the magic of Portunus.

## Usage 🕹️

### Define Your Queries

*"Honey, I got regex!"*

Think of an API key pattern. Now, wrap it up in a nice regex query and give it a memorable name. You'll have your keys on a silver platter in no time.

### Hunt Down Those Keys

*"The keymaster has logged on."*

As you navigate the web, Portunus will stealthily scan the pages for matching strings. It's like having your own personal key-fetching ninja.

### Feast Your Eyes on Your Bounty

*"Keys, glorious keys!"*

Found strings will appear in the Portunus popup, where you can copy, delete, or simply admire your collection. And when you're done, export your hard-earned loot to a CSV file.

Use your newfound power responsibly. (Or not. We're not your mom.)
